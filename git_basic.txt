git pull: update from remote repository

usually after some changes, use
1. git status: to check what you changed, can also use "git diff"
2. git add: to add add your changes
3. git commit: commit your changes. "-a" measns all changes, "-m" add messages
4. git push: update your file to remote repository

some times there are collitions between your and remote repository
1. git pull to check the differences
2. edit your file and follow steps above
3. git commit or keep remote changes

sometimes you want to return to a history or make some experiments
1. git log: check the history code you want to look back
2. git checkout <history code>: get back the history
3. git checkout -b <name>: create a new branch to save these changes

you want to check all the branches
1. git branch: check all the branches
2. git switch: switch to the branch you want. "-c" means create such a branch if there isn't one
